This allows using manual and algorithmic methods of asset management in a relatively new environment. This is one of the key factors which once promoted the emergence of various financial institutions which today apply their expertise from the traditional markets in managing cryptocurrency assets. The Quantum Hedge Fund was established by a group of independent experts in algorithmic and manual methods of asset management, together with acknowledged specialists in the field of development and administration of electronic systems with extensive experience from the traditional financial markets.

By operating on this market, Insulα both provides and benefits from deeper liquidity, better price discovery and a narrower market bid-ask spread, all together with increased certainty of execution. We thereby improve the ability of financial markets to allocate capital to its most productive uses. Both strategy (portfolio management) and execution (trading) is performed by algorithms. Our process iis runby algorithms to allow market operators to get rid of any form of bias that hinders​ decision making. Although people are subject to making biased decisions, computers are designed to only make rational decisions. Moreover, our experiments are continuously rebalanced, running automatically 24/7. Trading is operated by bots trading the crypto assets​ market that never closes, on a high frequency/low latency basis.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"647dd834-5e40-4882-b332-83cd772e7cb7":{"id_":"647dd834-5e40-4882-b332-83cd772e7cb7","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"76b2fc8b-b0fc-438b-91a0-dfdcf04bda1d","metadata":{},"hash":"MWXqynm1HSSl/yJa9kHHYHUteT/dEw/vFQUrWmDOfd4="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"3aac9cc5-bdbe-4f5d-89bf-c110f9aa5216","metadata":{},"hash":"KmstFuYBObPkrDro9T9KnyLIbFByLnepj4TrIAH3UiA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"d0793181-394f-41e7-92de-22f92ff6d66c","metadata":{},"hash":"tqK5nMXpgP0kS+xI3BkrH9Y3y7PlCrNQW/RHtlCT5Vo="}},"hash":"MeQYX3DuX3HUErzXDtMp6yhypbDG3uUhUCG3YKPYe2U=","text":"​ Insulα provides market operators with cutting edge technology, combining the features of algorithmic trading and blockchain, that sets us apart from traditional assets that are largely arbitraged and exploited already., Quantitative, , , , , , , https://www.insulainvestments.com/, https://www.linkedin.com/company/in-su-la/, https://crunchbase.com/organization/inusulÎ±-investment-management, , , London, , United Kingdom, Europe, Elyes Dhia,Jules Becci-Morin de la Rivière,Pierre Venereau\nLibertus Capital, Tier 3, Max Collingwood,Pamir Gelenbe, Libertus Capital focuses on decentralized applications, distributed applications, blockchain, early-stage investments, venture capital., FX, $4, , , , , , http://www.libertuscapital.com/, https://www.linkedin.com/company/libertus-capital/, https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/libertus-capital, , hello@libertuscapital.com, London, , United Kingdom, Europe, Barron Jeter,Max Collingwood,Pamir Gelenbe\nAaro Capital, Tier 3, Ankush Jain,Johannes Gugl,Peter Habermacher,Sebastien Jardon, The Aaro DLT Multifund is a fully-regulated, EU-domiciled Fund of Funds, focusing on the exciting and rapidly evolving DLT and Cryptoasset growth story.
